# Build Husk and package one IPA for every installer, validating the bundle before shipping it.
#
# No signing team is needed: AltStore / SideStore re-sign at install with the
# user's own profile. The IPA is signed ad hoc with Husk.entitlements embedded
# anyway, because TrollStore keeps the entitlements a binary already carries
# (RootHelper's signApp reads them from the binary) and invents only
# get-task-allow for one that has none. Signed this way, the same file gets the
# memory and dynamic-codesigning entitlements under TrollStore, and a sideloader
# simply replaces the signature.
#
# The validation step exists because a bundle missing CFBundleIdentifier or
# CFBundleExecutable builds and zips perfectly happily, and then fails to install
# with no useful message. Xcode does not inject those keys when a custom
# INFOPLIST_FILE is supplied without GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE, which is exactly how
# this project is set up.
