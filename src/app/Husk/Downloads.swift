/// Downloads from a link: one file, or a whole folder served from a computer (tools/serve-folder.py).
///
/// Every file is written into a `.part` beside where it goes and continued with a Range request from what is already on disk, so
/// nothing is fetched twice -- after a crash, an update, a server restart or a dropped connection. A file already in place at its
/// full size is not fetched at all. A finished APK is added to the library; anything else goes into Shared Storage at the path it had
/// in the served folder, which is where games that keep their data on /sdcard look for it.
///
/// Two ways to move the bytes:
///   - while Husk runs (in front, or kept running in the background by an iOS 26 continued processing task) it downloads itself,
///     several files at once, which is much faster than iOS's download service gives a background session;
///   - when Husk leaves the screen without that task, what is left of each file is handed to a background URLSession, which iOS
///     carries on with while Husk is suspended or closed. Those tasks are made while Husk is still active, or iOS would treat them as
///     work to do whenever it suits it.
