/*
 * Husk: save and restore the whole machine, so Android boots once ever.
 *
 * Booting Android under emulation costs about ten minutes: dex2oat compiles the
 * system, a hundred services start, and every instruction of it is translated.
 * None of that work is interesting and none of it changes between runs, so the
 * answer is not to make booting faster but to stop doing it. Save the machine
 * once it is up, and every later launch restores RAM and device state from disk
 * -- seconds, not minutes, and dex2oat never runs again.
 *
 * The state lands inside vdb (userdata), which is the writable qcow2. vda holds
 * the system image and is effectively read-only; putting snapshots there would
 * grow the file we distribute.
 *
 * Both calls must run under the BQL on the main loop. Saving is asked for from
 * a plain thread, so it hops through a bottom half exactly as the balloon does;
 * the bottom half then already holds the BQL and must not take it again.
 * Loading is different: it runs straight after qemu_init(), which returns with
 * the BQL held by this very thread, so it needs no bottom half at all.
 *
 * Neither call stops the CPUs by hand. save_snapshot() and the load sequence
 * below do it at the points where it is correct to do it, and a stop issued
 * outside those points is not merely redundant -- it is recorded in the state
 * that gets written out, and the machine comes back paused.

 * would always fail.
