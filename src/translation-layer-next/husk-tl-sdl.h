 * Drives a game built on SDL3 the way SDL's Java shell (SDLActivity) does.
 *
 * An SDL game is a native library with a `SDL_main`, behind an activity that extends org.libsdl.app.SDLActivity. That class loads SDL3 and the game's
 * library, tells SDL about the screen and the surface through native calls on itself, and runs SDL_main on a thread of its own through nativeRunMain;
 * SDL calls back into the activity for the few things only Java can answer (the context, the surface, the touch devices, locale). This does the same
 * from C, against the Java world husk-tl-jni-hle.c and this file provide.
