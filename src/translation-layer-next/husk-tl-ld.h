/*
 * The guest dynamic linker.
 *
 * Takes an Android app's arm64 shared objects out of its APK and makes them run
 * inside this process: it maps them into the executable region (husk-tl-xmem),
 * relocates them, binds their imports to the bionic shims (husk-tl-bionic) or to
 * each other, and runs their constructors.
 *
 * It follows Android's linker where that decides whether a library works:
 *
 *   - an import is looked up first in the importing library's own scope -- itself,
 *     then its DT_NEEDED closure in breadth-first order -- and only then in the
 *     system. Unity's libraries each carry a private C++ runtime, and binding one
 *     library's exceptions to another's would corrupt both;
 *   - a library's dependencies are mapped, relocated and initialised before it;
 *   - initialisers receive (argc, argv, envp), as bionic passes them.
 *
 * It differs where the platform forces it. Code and data are two views of the same
 * pages (see husk-tl-xmem.h), so an address handed out for a data object is its
 * writable view and one for code is its executable view; the loader rewrites
 * code that would otherwise reach data through the wrong one.
